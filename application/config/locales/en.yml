    description: "Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by
    a code-maker. The code-maker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates
    a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6."

    steps: "The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).
    In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers.
    The code-maker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces."

    plus: "A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers
    in the secret code and in the same position.
    For example:
    Secret number - 1234
    Input number - 6264
    Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)"

    minus: "A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers
    in the secret code but in a different position.
    For example:
    Secret number - 1234
    Input number - 6462
    Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)"

    space: "An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number."

    win_or_lose: "If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game.
    If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses."

    hint: "Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty).
    If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code."
