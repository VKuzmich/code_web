    • Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the application we’re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.</br>
    • The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.</br>
    • A + indicates an exact match - one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example</br>
      Secret number - 1234</br>
      Input number - 6264</br>
      Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)</br>
    • A - indicates a number match - one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example</br>
      Secret number - 1234</br>
      Input number - 6462</br>
      Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)</br>
    • An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.</br>
    • If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.</br>
    • Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.</br>"
  short_rules: Try to guess 4-digit number, that consists of numbers in a range from 1 to 6.
